# Quick Start 

## Step 1: Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in browser automatically at `http://localhost:8501`

## Step 2: Use the App

1. **Upload PDF**: Click "Upload a PDF Document" and select your PDF file
2. **Process**: Click the "🔄 Process PDF" button
3. **Ask Questions**: Type your question in the chat and press Enter
4. **View Sources**: Click "📌 View Source Documents" to see where the answer came from

## 💡 Tips

- For best results, use PDFs with text (not scanned images)
- The app processes the entire PDF, so large files may take longer
- You can ask multiple questions after processing one PDF
- Use "🗑️ Clear Chat History" to start a new conversation



**Slow processing?**
- Large PDFs take more time
- First-time HuggingFace model download takes time (only once)
- Check your internet connection for API calls

Happy Q&A!✨
